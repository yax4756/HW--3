/*
 * Design and implement an ADT that represents a triangle.
 * The data for the ADT should include the three sides of the triangle but could also include the triangle’s three angles.
 * This data should be in the private section of the class that implements the ADT.
 * Include at least two initialization operations: one that provides default values for the ADT’s data, and another that sets this data to client-supplied values.
 * These operations are the class’s constructors.
 * The ADT also should include operations that look at the values of the ADT’s data;
 *  - change the values of the ADT’s data;
 *  - compute the triangle’s area;
 *  - and determine whether the triangle is a right triangle, an equilateral triangle, or an isosceles triangle.
